# 🧠 Data Analytics Project

## 📋 Overview

This project demonstrates the **end-to-end data analytics process** — from loading and cleaning data in Python, performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, executing **SQL queries** for insights, and finally creating an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to visualize key findings.

The goal is to showcase strong analytical, technical, and visualization skills used in real-world business data analysis.

## 📂 Dataset

* **Name:** customer_shopping_behavior.csv
* **Source:**  Kaggle 
* **Description:** The dataset contains information about [briefly describe data — e.g., sales transactions, customer details, product information, etc.].
* **Size:**  3,900 rows , 18 columns

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Python** – Data loading, cleaning, and EDA (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
* **SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server)** – Querying and extracting insights
* **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard and visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code** – Development environment

---

## ⚙️ Steps Involved

### 1. Data Loading

* Imported the dataset using **pandas** in Python.
* Checked the structure, data types, and basic statistics.

### 2. Data Cleaning

* Handled missing values and duplicates.
* Fixed incorrect data types and standardized column names.
* Removed outliers where necessary.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
* Used **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for visual exploration.
* Identified patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

### 4. SQL Analysis

* Loaded the cleaned dataset into **SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server)**.
* Wrote SQL queries to answer key business questions, such as:

  * Top-performing products or regions
  * Monthly trends or growth
  * Customer segmentation insights

### 5. Power BI Dashboard

* Connected Power BI to the cleaned dataset or SQL database.
* Designed an **interactive dashboard** showing:

  * KPIs and summary metrics
  * Trends and comparisons
  * Filters and drill-downs for detailed analysis

### 6. Insights & Results

* Key insights discovered from the data:

  * [Example] Sales increased by 20% in Q3.
  * [Example] Region A has the highest profit margin.
  * [Example] Customer churn correlated with delivery delays.
